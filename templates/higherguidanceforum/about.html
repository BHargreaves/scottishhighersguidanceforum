     <h3>The Scottish Highers Guidance Forum is designed by a group of 2nd year Computing Science
        students at the University of Glasgow as part of our Web Application Development CourseWork.</h3>




     <h4>It is aimed at those studying their highers in Scotland, in order to make it easier for
        students and teachers to post questions, upload files according to their specific subject.</h4>
